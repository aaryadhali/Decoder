Break the ice
Spill the beans
Hit the nail on the head
Bite the bullet
Let the cat out of the bag
Beat around the bush
Barking up the wrong tree
A piece of cake
Back to square one
Cry over spilt milk
Cut corners
Cut to the chase
Hit the sack
Let sleeping dogs lie
Miss the boat
Once in a blue moon
Under the weather
You can't judge a book by its cover
